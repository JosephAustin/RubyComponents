# RubyComponents
A simple, thread-safe component based approach to data for ruby. 

This allows you to keep a megastructure of data that can read and write very quickly in binary. Individual components of the structure are representable in objects called Components, which are attached to Nodes. Basically, it's a has-a class system instead of an is-a class system, which adds a lot of flexibility.
